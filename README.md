# dropbox

1. Save the file inside dropbox

2. In Dropbox, grab the public link by right-clicking your CSS file and selecting Copy Public Link. This will copy a direct URL for your CSS file to your clipboard. If you're using the Dropbox web interface, just select the file and click the Share link button. 

3. Head over to your Docs Settings page and scroll down to the Design Details section. Paste the URL for your CSS file into the Stylesheet URL field. But wait, there's more! This next part is super important! 

 The link you just pasted looks something like this:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/19kh2r77nipor2w/test.css

You need to change the www in the URL to dl, so it looks like this:
https://dl.dropbox.com/s/19kh2r77nipor2w/test.css

This allows Docs to access the source of the file rather than the Dropbox page for the file. Click the Save button at the bottom of the page when you're finished.
